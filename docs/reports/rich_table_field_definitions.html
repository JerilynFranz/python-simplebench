<h1>Field Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#field-definitions" title="Link to this heading">🔗</a></h1>
<p>The descriptions of the fields included in each report type is described below.</p>
<section id="common-report-fields">
<h2>Common Report Fields<a class="headerlink" href="#common-report-fields" title="Link to this heading">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The following report fields are present in all of the report types below.</p>
<dl>
<dt>N</dt><dd><p>A complexity weighting used to indicate the input size for a benchmark.</p>
<p>A Big-O (<em>O</em>(<em>n</em>), etc) complexity weighting. This is used to indicate the ‘size’ of the
input to a parameterized benchmark. It defaults to 1 unless overridden by the benchmark.
The N value is used to help compare performance across different input sizes (if applicable)
and to analyze how the function scales with different input sizes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Iterations</dt><dd><p>The number of statistical samples taken for the benchmark.</p>
<p>The total number of iterations executed during the benchmark. An iteration is an execution of the benchmarked
function once for statistical reporting purposes. It may be composed of multiple actual rounds to improve accuracy
and precision, but is reported as a single count for the purposes of the table.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rounds</dt><dd><p>The number of times the benchmarked function is executed within a single iteration.</p>
<p>The number of rounds executed during an iteration. A round is a single execution of the benchmarked function.
Multiple rounds are often executed within an iteration to gather more accurate timing and performance data.
They are executed in rapid succession, and their results are aggregated to produce the final metrics for an iteration.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Elapsed Seconds</dt><dd><p>The total CPU time spent executing the benchmarked code.</p>
<p>The total measured elapsed time in seconds for all iterations of the benchmark. This metric provides an overview
of how long the benchmark took to complete. This does not include any setup or teardown time, focusing solely
on the execution time of the benchmarked code. By default, this measures <em>CPU time</em>, not <em>wall-clock time</em>, to provide
a more accurate representation of the code’s performance. It can be overridden to measure wall-clock time instead
if so desired.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="operations-per-second">
<h2>Operations Per Second<a class="headerlink" href="#operations-per-second" title="Link to this heading">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The <cite>operations per second</cite> report provides a detailed overview of
the performance of the benchmarked code in terms of how many operations it can
perform per second. This is a common metric used to evaluate the efficiency of
code, especially in performance-critical applications.</p>
<p>Output numbers are scaled to appropriate units (Ops/s, kOps/s, MOps/s, etc) for easier readability.</p>
<p>The fields always in an <cite>operations per second</cite> report are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>mean Ops/s</dt><dd><p>The average number of operations per second.</p>
<p>The arithmetic mean average number of of operations per second (Ops/s) performed during the benchmark.
This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of operations executed by the total elapsed time,
then scaling it an appropriate factor (for example, kOps/s) for easier readability. It provides a quick overview
of the benchmark’s performance.</p>
</dd>
<dt>median Ops/s</dt><dd><p>The 50th percentile (middle value) of operations per second.</p>
<p>The median (50th percentile) number of operations per second (Ops/s) performed during the benchmark.
This metric represents the middle value of the Ops/s measurements collected during the benchmark,
providing a robust measure of central tendency that is less affected by outliers compared to the mean.</p>
</dd>
<dt>min Ops/s</dt><dd><p>The lowest (worst) performance recorded across all iterations.</p>
<p>The minimum number of operations per second (Ops/s) recorded during the benchmark. This metric indicates the
lowest performance observed during the benchmark runs, which can be useful for identifying potential bottlenecks
or performance issues.</p>
</dd>
<dt>max Ops/s</dt><dd><p>The highest (best) performance recorded across all iterations.</p>

highest performance observed during the benchmark runs, showcasing the best-case scenario for the benchmarked code.</p>
</dd>
<dt>5th Ops/s</dt><dd><p>The 5th percentile of operations per second.</p>
<p>The 5th percentile number of operations per second (Ops/s) recorded during the benchmark. This metric indicates
that 5% of the Ops/s measurements were below this value, providing insight into the lower end of the typical
performance distribution.</p>
</dd>
<dt>95th Ops/s</dt><dd><p>The 95th percentile of operations per second.</p>
<p>The 95th percentile number of operations per second (Ops/s) recorded during the benchmark. This metric indicates
that 95% of the Ops/s measurements were below this value, providing insight into the upper end of the typical
performance distribution.</p>
</dd>
<dt>std dev kOps/s</dt><dd><p>A measure of the variation or inconsistency in performance.</p>
<p>The standard deviation of the operations per second (Ops/s) measurements collected during the benchmark. This metric
quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in the Ops/s values, providing insight into the consistency of the
benchmark’s performance. A lower standard deviation indicates more consistent performance, while a higher standard
deviation suggests greater variability in the results.</p>
</dd>
<dt>rsd%</dt><dd><p>A normalized measure of performance inconsistency, expressed as a percentage.</p>
<p>The relative standard deviation (RSD) expressed as a percentage. This metric is calculated by dividing the standard
deviation by the mean and multiplying by 100. It provides a normalized measure of variability, allowing for easier
comparison of consistency across different benchmarks or parameter configurations. A lower RSD% indicates more consistent
performance relative to the mean, while a higher RSD% suggests greater variability in the results.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="timing">
<h2>Timing<a class="headerlink" href="#timing" title="Link to this heading">🔗</a></h2>
<p>A <cite>timing</cite> report focuses on the time taken to execute the benchmarked
code, rather than the number of operations per second. It provides insights into
the average time per operation and other timing-related statistics.</p>
<p>Output numbers are scaled to appropriate units (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, etc)
for easier readability.</p>
<p>The fields in this report include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>mean s/op</dt><dd><p>The average time in seconds per operation.</p>
<p>The arithmetic mean average time in seconds per operation (s/op). This metric is calculated by dividing the total
elapsed time by the total number of operations. It provides a direct measure of how long a single operation
takes on average.</p>
</dd>
<dt>median s/op</dt><dd><p>The 50th percentile (middle value) of seconds per operation.</p>
<p>The median (50th percentile) time in seconds per operation. This metric represents the middle value of the timing
measurements, providing a robust measure of central tendency that is less affected by unusually fast or slow
iterations (outliers).</p>
</dd>
<dt>min s/op</dt><dd><p>The lowest (fastest) time per operation recorded across all iterations.</p>

<p>The maximum time in seconds per operation recorded during the benchmark. This metric indicates the worst-case
performance observed, which can be useful for identifying potential bottlenecks or performance stalls.</p>
</dd>
<dt>5th s/op</dt><dd><p>The 5th percentile of seconds per operation. 5% of iterations were faster than this.</p>
<p>The 5th percentile time in seconds per operation. This metric indicates that 5% of the timing measurements were
faster than this value, providing insight into the best-case end of the performance distribution.</p>
</dd>
<dt>95th s/op</dt><dd><p>The 95th percentile of seconds per operation. 95% of iterations were faster than this.</p>
<p>The 95th percentile time in seconds per operation. This metric indicates that 95% of the timing measurements were
faster than this value, providing insight into the typical worst-case performance, excluding extreme outliers.</p>
</dd>

<h2>Memory Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-usage" title="Link to this heading">🔗</a></h2>
<p>A <cite>memory usage</cite> Rich Table report provides information about the memory consumption
of the benchmarked code. It includes statistics on average and peak memory usage
during the benchmark runs. Output numbers are scaled to appropriate units (bytes, kB, MB, etc)
for easier readability.</p>
<p>For a <cite>memory usage</cite> Rich Table report, two tables are generated: one for average
memory usage and another for peak memory usage. The key fields in these tables include:</p>
