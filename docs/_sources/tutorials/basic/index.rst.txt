Basic Usage Tutorial
====================

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a simple benchmark using SimpleBench, run it, and generate a report.


The minimal code required to create and run a benchmark using SimpleBench is creating
a script that defines a function to be benchmarked with `@simplebench.benchmark`
and that calls `simplebench.main()` and then running it.

When you run the code below, SimpleBench automatically runs the benchmark function
`addition_benchmark`, collecting performance and memory statistics, and generating
a report. By specifying :doc:`command_line_options` you can generate output in
multiple formats, including rich text tables (like the one below), graphs, CSV
files, and JSON reports and select which statistics to report.

It runs using defaults setting for number of iterations, warmup runs, etc. You can
customize these settings via parameters set on the `@simplebench.benchmark` decorator.

  .. include:: basic_benchmark.py
    :literal:

Save this code to a file, for example `basic_benchmark.py`, and then run it from
your terminal:

.. code-block:: shell

    python basic_benchmark.py --rich-table.ops --progress
