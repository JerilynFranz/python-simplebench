Rich Tables are a popular way to display benchmark results in a clear and
concise manner. SimpleBench leverages the `rich <https://github.com/Textualize/rich>`_
library to generate these tables, providing visually appealing and easy-to-read reports.

To generate a Rich Table report, you can use the `--rich-table.ops` command-line
option when running your benchmarks. This will produce tables that summarize the
performance metrics for each benchmark, including operations per second, average
time per operation, memory usage, and peak memory usage.

Here is an example of how to run a benchmark script with Rich Table reporting:

.. code-block:: shell
  :caption: Running a benchmark with Rich Table report
  :name: run-benchmark-rich-table

    python my_benchmark_script.py --rich-table.ops --progress

This command will execute the benchmarks defined in `my_benchmark_script.py` and
generate a Rich Table report displaying the operations-per-second results in
the terminal. A progress bar will also be shown during the execution of the benchmarks.

A basic Rich Table output will look something like this:

.. code-block:: text
  :caption: Basic Sample Rich Table Output
  :name: basic-sample-rich-table-output

                                                                 addition_benchmark
                                                                operations per second

                                            A simple addition benchmark of Python's built-in sum function.

The table includes various statistics such as the number of iterations, rounds,
elapsed time, mean and median operations per second, minimum and maximum operations
per second, as well as standard deviation and relative standard deviation (rsd%).

.. note::
   To avoid "false precision", statistical results are shown to three significant digits.
   Due to the inherent variability of performance measurement, any further digits are
   typically meaningless statistical noise.

   This is not an issue with SimpleBench itself, but rather a fundamental aspect of benchmarking and performance
   measurement in the real world.

The basic fields always displayed in a Rich Table report are:

N
  A complexity weighting used to indicate the input size for a benchmark.

  A Big-O (*O*\ (*n*), etc) complexity weighting. This is used to indicate the 'size' of the
  input to a parameterized benchmark. It defaults to 1 unless overridden by the benchmark.
  The N value is used to help compare performance across different input sizes (if applicable)
  and to analyze how the function scales with different input sizes.

Iterations
  The number of statistical samples taken for the benchmark.

  The total number of iterations executed during the benchmark. An iteration is an execution of the benchmarked
  function once for statistical reporting purposes. It may be composed of multiple actual rounds to improve accuracy
  and precision, but is reported as a single count for the purposes of the table.

Rounds
  The number of times the benchmarked function is executed within a single iteration.

  The number of rounds executed during an iteration. A round is a single execution of the benchmarked function.
  Multiple rounds are often executed within an iteration to gather more accurate timing and performance data.
  They are executed in rapid succession, and their results are aggregated to produce the final metrics for an iteration.

Elapsed Seconds
  The total CPU time spent executing the benchmarked code.

  The total measured elapsed time in seconds for all iterations of the benchmark. This metric provides an overview
  of how long the benchmark took to complete. This does not include any setup or teardown time, focusing solely
  on the execution time of the benchmarked code. By default, this measures *CPU time*, not *wall-clock time*, to provide
  a more accurate representation of the code's performance. It can be overridden to measure wall-clock time instead
  if so desired.

mean Ops/s
  The average number of operations per second.

  The arithmetic mean average number of of operations per second (Ops/s) performed during the benchmark.
  This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of operations executed by the total elapsed time,
  then scaling it an appropriate factor (for example, kOps/s) for easier readability. It provides a quick overview
  of the benchmark's performance.

median Ops/s
  The 50th percentile (middle value) of operations per second.

  The median (50th percentile) number of operations per second (Ops/s) performed during the benchmark.
  This metric represents the middle value of the Ops/s measurements collected during the benchmark,
  providing a robust measure of central tendency that is less affected by outliers compared to the mean.
 
min Ops/s
  The lowest (worst) performance recorded across all iterations.

  The minimum number of operations per second (Ops/s) recorded during the benchmark. This metric indicates the
  lowest performance observed during the benchmark runs, which can be useful for identifying potential bottlenecks
  or performance issues.

max Ops/s
  The highest (best) performance recorded across all iterations.

  The maximum number of operations per second (Ops/s) recorded during the benchmark. This metric indicates the
  highest performance observed during the benchmark runs, showcasing the best-case scenario for the benchmarked code.

5th Ops/s
  The 5th percentile of operations per second.

  The 5th percentile number of operations per second (Ops/s) recorded during the benchmark. This metric indicates
  that 5% of the Ops/s measurements were below this value, providing insight into the lower end of the typical
  performance distribution.

95th Ops/s
  The 95th percentile of operations per second.

  The 95th percentile number of operations per second (Ops/s) recorded during the benchmark. This metric indicates
  that 95% of the Ops/s measurements were below this value, providing insight into the upper end of the typical
  performance distribution.

std dev kOps/s
  A measure of the variation or inconsistency in performance.

  The standard deviation of the operations per second (Ops/s) measurements collected during the benchmark. This metric
  quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in the Ops/s values, providing insight into the consistency of the
  benchmark's performance. A lower standard deviation indicates more consistent performance, while a higher standard
  deviation suggests greater variability in the results.

rsd%
  A normalized measure of performance inconsistency, expressed as a percentage.

  The relative standard deviation (RSD) expressed as a percentage. This metric is calculated by dividing the standard
  deviation by the mean and multiplying by 100. It provides a normalized measure of variability, allowing for easier 
  comparison of consistency across different benchmarks or configurations. A lower RSD% indicates more consistent
  performance relative to the mean, while a higher RSD% suggests greater variability in the results.
