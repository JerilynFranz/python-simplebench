<h2>Rich Table Report<a class="headerlink" href="#rich-table-report" title="Link to this heading">🔗</a></h2>
<p id="id1">Rich Tables are a popular way to display benchmark results in a clear and
concise manner. SimpleBench leverages the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich">rich</a>
library to generate these tables, providing visually appealing and easy-to-read reports.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Rich Table reports are just one of several reporting options available in SimpleBench.
You can also generate CSV reports, graph reports, and JSON reports, each providing
different perspectives on your benchmark results.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="command_line_options.html"><span class="doc">Command-Line Options</span></a> section for more details on how to
generate and customize these reports.</p>
</div>
<p>To generate a Rich Table report, you can use an option like <cite>–rich-table.ops</cite>
when running your benchmarks. For example:</p>
<div class="literal-block-wrapper docutils container" id="run-benchmark-rich-table">
<div class="code-block-caption"><span class="caption-text">Running a benchmark with a Rich Table report</span><a class="headerlink" href="#run-benchmark-rich-table" title="Link to this code">🔗</a></div>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">  </span>python<span class="w"> </span>my_benchmark_script.py<span class="w"> </span>--rich-table.ops<span class="w"> </span>--progress
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This command executes the benchmarks in <cite>my_benchmark_script.py</cite> and generates
a Rich Table in the terminal displaying the operations-per-second results.
A basic output will look something like this:</p>
<div class="literal-block-wrapper docutils container" id="sample-rich-table-output">
<div class="code-block-caption"><span class="caption-text">Sample Rich Table Output (operations per second)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#sample-rich-table-output" title="Link to this code">🔗</a></div>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>                                                                   addition_benchmark
                                                                operations per second

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>To avoid “false precision”, statistical results are shown to three significant digits.
Due to the inherent variability of performance measurement, any further digits are
typically meaningless statistical noise.</p>
<p>This is not an issue with SimpleBench itself, but rather a fundamental aspect of benchmarking and performance
measurement in the real world.</p>
</div>
<section id="report-variations-and-destinations">
<h3>Report Variations and Destinations<a class="headerlink" href="#report-variations-and-destinations" title="Link to this heading">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The example above shows an operations-per-second report printed to the console.
SimpleBench provides several variations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><cite>–rich-table</cite>: Generates tables for all result types (ops, timing, and memory).</p></li>
<li><p><cite>–rich-table.ops</cite>: Generates tables only for operations-per-second results.</p></li>
<li><p><cite>–rich-table.timing</cite>: Generates tables only for timing results.</p></li>
<li><p><cite>–rich-table.memory</cite>: Generates tables only for memory usage results.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By default, reports are displayed in the console. You can send a report to other
destinations, such as the filesystem, by appending the destination name. For example,
to save the report to a file instead of printing it:</p>
<div class="literal-block-wrapper docutils container" id="rich-table-ops-filesystem">

<section id="advanced-features">
<h3>Advanced Features<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-features" title="Link to this heading">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Beyond the basic fields shown above, SimpleBench’s Rich Table reports
also support advanced features such as:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Parameterized Benchmarks</dt><dd><p>Displaying results for benchmarks that take parameters,
allowing for analysis of performance across different input sizes or configurations.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Custom Complexity Weightings:</dt><dd><p>Including Big-O complexity weight/size annotations to help analyze how performance
scales with input size.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These features make Rich Table reports a powerful tool for understanding
the performance characteristics of your code in a clear and structured manner.</p>
<section id="parameterized-benchmarks">
<h4>Parameterized Benchmarks<a class="headerlink" href="#parameterized-benchmarks" title="Link to this heading">🔗</a></h4>
<p>When benchmarks are parameterized, SimpleBench generates additional columns in the
Rich Table report for each parameter value requested for display.</p>
<p>This allows you to easily compare performance across different configurations.
For example, if you have a benchmark that takes an input size
parameter, the report can show how performance varies with different input sizes.</p>
<p>See the <span class="xref std std-doc">defining_benchmarks</span> section for more details on defining and using
parameterized benchmarks.</p>
</section>
<section id="custom-complexity-weightings">
<h4>Custom Complexity Weightings<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-complexity-weightings" title="Link to this heading">🔗</a></h4>
<p>Related to parameterized benchmarks, SimpleBench allows you to specify
custom complexity weightings (number/size weighting)for your benchmarks. These weightings
are displayed in the Rich Table report as the N value, helping you analyze
how performance scales with input size and parameterization.</p>
<p>For example, you might specify that a benchmark set covers input sizes 1, 20, 100, 1000,
which will be indicated in the N column of the report with a row for each size.</p>
<p>When defining a parameterized benchmark, you can provide complexity weightings that
reflect the expected performance characteristics of the code being benchmarked and
are matched with the parameters being used. This helps in understanding how the performance
of the benchmarked code changes as the input size or other parameters vary.</p>
<p>These advanced features make Rich Table reports a powerful tool for analyzing
the performance of parameterized benchmarks and understanding the scalability
of your code.</p>

<section id="operations-per-second">
<h3>Operations Per Second<a class="headerlink" href="#operations-per-second" title="Link to this heading">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The <cite>operations per second</cite> Rich Table report provides a detailed overview of
the performance of the benchmarked code in terms of how many operations it can
perform per second. This is a common metric used to evaluate the efficiency of
code, especially in performance-critical applications.</p>
<p>Output numbers are scaled to appropriate units (Ops/s, kOps/s, MOps/s, etc) for easier readability.</p>
<p>The basic fields always displayed in an <cite>operations per second</cite> Rich Table report are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>N</dt><dd><p>A complexity weighting used to indicate the input size for a benchmark.</p>
<p>A Big-O (<em>O</em>(<em>n</em>), etc) complexity weighting. This is used to indicate the ‘size’ of the
input to a parameterized benchmark. It defaults to 1 unless overridden by the benchmark.
The N value is used to help compare performance across different input sizes (if applicable)
and to analyze how the function scales with different input sizes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Iterations</dt><dd><p>The number of statistical samples taken for the benchmark.</p>
<p>The total number of iterations executed during the benchmark. An iteration is an execution of the benchmarked
function once for statistical reporting purposes. It may be composed of multiple actual rounds to improve accuracy
and precision, but is reported as a single count for the purposes of the table.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rounds</dt><dd><p>The number of times the benchmarked function is executed within a single iteration.</p>
<p>The number of rounds executed during an iteration. A round is a single execution of the benchmarked function.
Multiple rounds are often executed within an iteration to gather more accurate timing and performance data.
They are executed in rapid succession, and their results are aggregated to produce the final metrics for an iteration.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Elapsed Seconds</dt><dd><p>The total CPU time spent executing the benchmarked code.</p>
<p>The total measured elapsed time in seconds for all iterations of the benchmark. This metric provides an overview
of how long the benchmark took to complete. This does not include any setup or teardown time, focusing solely
on the execution time of the benchmarked code. By default, this measures <em>CPU time</em>, not <em>wall-clock time</em>, to provide
a more accurate representation of the code’s performance. It can be overridden to measure wall-clock time instead
if so desired.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mean Ops/s</dt><dd><p>The average number of operations per second.</p>
<p>The arithmetic mean average number of of operations per second (Ops/s) performed during the benchmark.
This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of operations executed by the total elapsed time,
then scaling it an appropriate factor (for example, kOps/s) for easier readability. It provides a quick overview
of the benchmark’s performance.</p>
</dd>
<dt>median Ops/s</dt><dd><p>The 50th percentile (middle value) of operations per second.</p>
<p>The median (50th percentile) number of operations per second (Ops/s) performed during the benchmark.
This metric represents the middle value of the Ops/s measurements collected during the benchmark,
providing a robust measure of central tendency that is less affected by outliers compared to the mean.</p>
</dd>
<dt>min Ops/s</dt><dd><p>The lowest (worst) performance recorded across all iterations.</p>
<p>The minimum number of operations per second (Ops/s) recorded during the benchmark. This metric indicates the
lowest performance observed during the benchmark runs, which can be useful for identifying potential bottlenecks
or performance issues.</p>
</dd>
<dt>max Ops/s</dt><dd><p>The highest (best) performance recorded across all iterations.</p>
<p>The maximum number of operations per second (Ops/s) recorded during the benchmark. This metric indicates the
highest performance observed during the benchmark runs, showcasing the best-case scenario for the benchmarked code.</p>
</dd>
<dt>5th Ops/s</dt><dd><p>The 5th percentile of operations per second.</p>
<p>The 5th percentile number of operations per second (Ops/s) recorded during the benchmark. This metric indicates
that 5% of the Ops/s measurements were below this value, providing insight into the lower end of the typical
performance distribution.</p>
</dd>
<dt>95th Ops/s</dt><dd><p>The 95th percentile of operations per second.</p>
<p>The 95th percentile number of operations per second (Ops/s) recorded during the benchmark. This metric indicates
that 95% of the Ops/s measurements were below this value, providing insight into the upper end of the typical
performance distribution.</p>
</dd>
<dt>std dev kOps/s</dt><dd><p>A measure of the variation or inconsistency in performance.</p>
<p>The standard deviation of the operations per second (Ops/s) measurements collected during the benchmark. This metric
quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in the Ops/s values, providing insight into the consistency of the
benchmark’s performance. A lower standard deviation indicates more consistent performance, while a higher standard
deviation suggests greater variability in the results.</p>
</dd>
<dt>rsd%</dt><dd><p>A normalized measure of performance inconsistency, expressed as a percentage.</p>
<p>The relative standard deviation (RSD) expressed as a percentage. This metric is calculated by dividing the standard
deviation by the mean and multiplying by 100. It provides a normalized measure of variability, allowing for easier
comparison of consistency across different benchmarks or parameter configurations. A lower RSD% indicates more consistent
performance relative to the mean, while a higher RSD% suggests greater variability in the results.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="timing">
<h3>Timing<a class="headerlink" href="#timing" title="Link to this heading">🔗</a></h3>
<p>A <cite>timing</cite> Rich Table report focuses on the time taken to execute the benchmarked
code, rather than the number of operations per second. It provides insights into
the average time per operation and other timing-related statistics.</p>
<p>Output numbers are scaled to appropriate units (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, etc)
for easier readability.</p>
<p>The fields in this report include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Mean s/op</dt><dd><p>The average time in seconds per operation.</p>
<p>The arithmetic mean average time in seconds per operation (s/op). This metric is calculated by dividing the total
elapsed time by the total number of operations. It provides a direct measure of how long a single operation
