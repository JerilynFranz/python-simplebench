    Defines a method signature for rendering benchmark results for a given Case and Section.

    The signature must match the following:

    `def method_name(self, *, case: Case, section: Section, options: ReporterOptions) -> str | bytes | Text | Table:`

    Subsets of 'str | bytes | Text | Table' for the return type are allowed for specific reporters.

        While required in the protocol, the value of the section argument should be ignored by reporters that do not
        render reports by section. It will be set to Section.NULL by the render_by_case() method.

            section (Section): The Section of the report to render (ignore value if not applicable to reporter).
            options (ReporterOptions): The reporter-specific options.
