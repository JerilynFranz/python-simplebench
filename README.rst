SimpleBench
===========

**SimpleBench** is a Python framework for benchmarking and performance testing of code.

As such it has the following goals:

- Simple to use for simple benchmarks
- Powerful enough to handle sophisticated benchmarking needs out-of-the-box
- Flexible enough to handle complex custom benchmarking scenarios
- Extensible to allow users to add their own functionality as needed
