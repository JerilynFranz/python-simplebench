## Name

simplebench

## Description

Benchmarking suite (WIP, pre-alpha)

This is **IN DEVELOPMENT** benchmarking suite. The APIs and commandline interfaces are still
subject to radical change without any notice until it reaches the first alpha release.

If you want to play with it, feel free - but this is absolutely not yet ready for production use yet.

I'm hoping to reach the first alpha release around the third week of November, 2025.

## Installation

### Via PyPI

```shell
pip3 install simplebench
```

### From source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JerilynFranz/python-simplebench
cd python-simplebench
pip3 install .
```
